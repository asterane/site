## About Me {#about-me}

Hi, my name is Matthew Rothlisberger. I am an aspiring electrical
engineer and software developer.

I am passionate about engineering as a mechanism to improve our world;
I find it fulfilling to implement effective solutions for difficult
and meaningful problems. Whenever possible, I try to discover, learn,
and use the best tools available. My [Projects]({{< relref "projects" >}}) showcase some of my
work.


## About This Site {#about-this-site}

This site serves as a portfolio of my education, my work experience,
and of the engineering projects I have taken on over the
years. Sufficiently notable projects will be added and updated as I
make progress.

My [Blog]({{< relref "blog" >}}) is also hosted here. It is a place for me to write about
problems and solutions that interest me, primarily in the fields of
electrical engineering and software engineering. New posts will arrive
when I write them.

For more information on the technologies used to build this site,
consult the [Colophon]({{< relref "colophon" >}}).


## Education {#education}

To date, most recent to least recent:


### Utah State University {#utah-state-university}

_2021 - 2025_

**Admitted**

**B.S. Electrical Engineering**

I have been admitted to Utah State University for a bachelor of
science degree in electrical engineering. Because of the ongoing
pandemic, I chose to defer my admission and will be starting classes
around early 2021.


### Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology {#thomas-jefferson-high-school-for-science-and-technology}

_2016 - 2020_

**Graduated**

**Electrical Engineering Focus**

I attended TJHSST for ninth through twelfth grades after being
admitted through an extensive application process. The highlights of
my experience were the two years of hands on electrical engineering
classes I took. We began with analog circuit design and built up to
processor design, signal processing, and more.


## Work Experience {#work-experience}

Again, most to least recent:


### Junior Software Developer {#junior-software-developer}

_2020 -_

**Freelance**

I am freelancing while seeking full time remote employment. During
this time, I am working on a variety of software projects using
languages and tools I am familiar with. Whenever I have time, I work
on open source and make an effort to learn valuable new engineering
skills.


### Senior Audiovisual Technician {#senior-audiovisual-technician}

_2018 - 2020_

**Fairfax County Public Schools**

I was responsible for overseeing dozens of community events in an
auditorium that seats several hundred people. I developed proficiency
hanging and programming lighting fixtures; interfacing audio equipment
and equalizing signals; and working with customers of many cultures to
see their events through. I often worked under time pressure and under
unforeseen circumstances to ensure that events ran well.
