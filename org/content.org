*** About Me
Hi, my name is Matthew Rothlisberger. I am an aspiring electrical
engineer and software developer.

I am passionate about engineering as a mechanism to improve our world;
I find it fulfilling to implement effective solutions for difficult
and meaningful problems. Whenever possible, I try to discover, learn,
and use the best tools available. My [[* Projects]] showcase some of my
work.

*** About This Site
This site serves as a portfolio of my education, my work experience,
and of the engineering projects I have taken on over the
years. Sufficiently notable projects will be added and updated as I
make progress.

My [[* Blog]] is also hosted here. It is a place for me to write about
problems and solutions that interest me, primarily in the fields of
electrical engineering and software engineering. New posts will arrive
when I write them.

This is a list of my personal projects. Many are engineering efforts
and some were undertaken for the sake of learning. I feel that all
those listed are notable enough to include for now, but some will be
removed in the future, and more will certainly be added.

Several of these projects are not yet completed to my satisfaction,
and I am continuing work on the ones that I consider most valuable.

#+TOC: headlines 1

All of the content on this site is either my work or is in the public
domain. I designed and implemented the user interface and style
myself.

To make this project easier, and serve the website to you, I used a
stack of excellent tools.

*** Creating site content

**** GNU Emacs
In my opinion, the greatest text editor / integrated development
environment ever created. Finely honed and infinitely customizable.

**** Org Mode
A feature filled hierarchical document creation system for Emacs, and
the closest to perfect to do management you can get.

**** GIMP
High quality image editor and converter, used to alter or touch up
many of the images I use on the site.

**** Vivaldi
Great browser based on Chromium, used to assess the appearance of the
site and debug the interactions between HTML, CSS, and JS.

*** Generating the site

**** GNU Make
Extremely flexible system for creating recipes to build software. Used
to condense several useful operations into single commands.

**** GNU Emacs
Used as an Emacs Lisp interpreter, running the functions required to
have all my source files converted into HTML for Jekyll.

**** =ox-hugo=
Backend for the Org mode exporter that generates Markdown content
files with front matter for Hugo, from my Org files.

**** Hugo
Fast and flexible static site generator that assembles my HTML layouts
and my generated content files into a complete website.

*** Serving the site

**** Git
Universally used version control system, handles tracking changes and
pushing site updates to GitHub.

**** Magit
Fantastic interface to Git from within Emacs. Provides convenient
keybindings and useful information for all version control tasks.

**** GitHub
Free hosting of source repositories and static sites alike; simply the
best option available for this site.

*** Languages used

**** HTML5
HyperText Markup Language, the standard internet markup language.

**** CSS3
Cascading Style Sheets, the standard internet styling language.

**** JavaScript
The standard internet scripting language.

**** Go Templates
Hugo's template language; enables easy dynamic generation of static
content.

**** TOML
Markup language used for Hugo configuration, like setting sitewide
variables.

**** Emacs Lisp
Lisp dialect which describes much of Emacs functionality. Used to
write directives for the Org mode publisher.

**** Makefile
Simple declarative language used to automate software builds.

**** Zsh
Extension of the Bourne again shell, used for scripting.

**** English
Germanic language written with a simple alphabet. Used to express
ideas to others.

** DONE Hello World!
CLOSED: [2020-09-22 Tue 12:00]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: hello-world
:END:

I have been interested in putting up my own website for some time, and
I've finally decided to make it happen. The coronavirus pandemic (I've
seen it referred to in one news article as "the ongoing global
situation") has offered me more time than expected to work on personal
projects, so I have been assembling this site for the last several
days. In this post, I briefly discuss my motivations and goals.
<!--more-->

*** My Intent
This site was conceived as a place to share my personal portfolio of
projects with friends, colleagues, and potential employers. The
resources comprising each project are stored in a repository on
GitHub, which this site links to. Eventually, I will create additional
pages on this site to showcase my work.

Each of the projects that interest me most, present or future, will
have their own showcase pages featuring explanations, diagrams, and
image galleries. Projects intended to be broadly useful to others will
also have documentation explaining features, specifications, and a
roadmap for future development.

*** This Blog
A primary motivation to create my own site is my interest in writing
about technology and engineering. Writing is a fantastic way to
organize and reconsider thoughts about a topic, and to gain new
insights. I have many exciting projects in the pipeline, almost all of
which I intend to write about in this blog.

My posts will focus on engineering problems that are interesting to
me; I will strive to make them interesting for any future readers of
this blog as well. I want to work from first principles, solve
difficult problems, and make things that help people. If all goes to
plan, my writings here will chronicle that work.

*** What Else
Check out my [[*Projects][projects]]! There are some really cool
things there. Or perhaps you would like to learn more [[*About][about
me]]. If you would like to contact me, use the link below. Thank you
for reading.


** TODO A Tale of Jekyll and Hugo
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: a-tale-of-jekyll-and-hugo
:END:

*** Getting Started
When I chose to pursue this project, I had a few important goals. Here is
a list of the qualities I wanted my site to have.

- Hosting should be free. I'm not interested in paying for a domain
  name or hosting until I have a good reason to do so.
- I should have complete control of content and format. No irremovable
  themes, no "proudly powered by x" footer.
- It should be easy to publish content. I don't want to have to muck
  around with HTML when I am just writing a blog post.
- The site should be light, fast, and responsive. The less there is to
  design, and the fewer dependencies, the better.
- I should understand every part of my site, and the process by which
  it is published. This is a learning exercise as much as anything.

**** Resources
- https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-jekyll.html
- https://opensource.com/article/20/3/blog-emacs
- http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/

**** GitHub Pages
Free hosting along with total control over the site is a high bar, but
thankfully GitHub has been offering this service for some time. I
began by creating a new public repository with the name required by
Pages: =asterane.github.io=. When I got going with this project a few
days ago, I created a folder on my machine with the same name. GitHub
Pages automatically integrates with the static site generator Jekyll,
which is where our story leads next.

**** Jekyll
The premise of Jekyll is simple: you provide content for your site as
Markdown or as HTML files containing only a =<body>= section. This
content is assembled into pages using HTML layouts provided by you or
by a premade theme. You can use a templating language called Liquid in
your Markdown or your HTML to dynamically create page content as
Jekyll runs. Liquid can do things like list all blog posts, or add
HTML tags to a code snippet for highlighting.

Final pages for your site are dynamically generated by Jekyll, but
then served statically. You cannot have a backend, or any databases,
which is just fine for a simple site like this one. In a way, Jekyll
serves as a linker, combining your content with layouts to create full
pages that are ready for a browser to display. To test out your site,
it is important to install Jekyll on your own computer.

Jekyll comes as a Ruby gem (a package written and distributed in
Ruby). It's possible to use =gem install jekyll bundle=, as
recommended by the [[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/][quickstart guide]];
it was easier for me to use the Arch User Repository, which provides
the relevant gems as distinct packages. After running =jekyll new
asterane.github.io=, a new default Jekyll site was created on my
computer. To check it out, I ran =bundle exec jekyll serve= and
navigated to http://localhost:4000.


*** Generating Content
My love affair with Emacs began shortly after my senior year of high
school was abruptly truncated by the aforementioned pandemic. I will
undoubtedly be writing more about Emacs in the future, but suffice it
to say that this tool has no equal. I knew that I had to be able to
create my site using Emacs. What's more, I wanted to write all of my
content in Org mode, the todo management and document creation system
included with Emacs.
